# Queues management

Management of asynchronous tasks between backend services


## Status

This is a new library and is considered to be in **Beta** and the APIs can change as we adapt more use cases.

We'll follow semantic versioning, so, once we reach a stable state and release 1.0.0 API's should be stable inside releases with the same major number.
